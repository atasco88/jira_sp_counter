Count Jira Story Points from Query

Once extension is installed, run a Jira query.  Be sure that "Story Points" is an included column in the result view.  When clicked, the extension will pop up an alert box with a Story Point count for that page of the result.  If there are multiple pages, you will need to navigate to each page and then take the sum of the count from each page.
